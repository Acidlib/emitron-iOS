# Contributing to emitron

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, and thanks for expressing an interest in contributing to the raywenderlich.com app.

## Testing

Once in Xcode, select the `Emitron` scheme and use `CMD+U` to run the tests.

Don't forget to add tests for your new features.

If you are fixing a single GitHub issue in particular, you can add a test named `testGH<issue number>` to ensure
that your fix is working. This will also help prevent regression.

## Access Tokens

As mentioned in the readme, __emitron__ requires two secret tokens. This repo contains
a sample API token, that will allow you to interact with the API, allowing you to
develop the app.

However, it does not contain the token that will allow access to downloads. If you
wish to work on the video downloads feature, please contact engineering@razeware.com
and link to the development proposal in GitHub and you will be provided with a token.


## New Features

If you would like to suggest new features, please open an issue for discussion, and
include a development proposal. Although the app is open source, Razeware reserves
the right to direct new feature development.


Thanks!
