# Security Policy


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you come across a security vulnerability in __emitron__, or any of the
raywenderlich.com infrastructure that it connects to, please do not file an
issue on GitHub.

Instead, please document your issue as fully as you can, and email it directly
to engineering@razeware.com.

We take security very seriously, and will assess any reports before looking to
get them fixed as soon as possible.


Thank you.
